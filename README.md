# Advent of Code
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Advent of Code can be accessed here: https://adventofcode.com/.

## Current Progress
Each year offers 25 days of challenges, each day containing two parts (second part is available once the first part has been solved correctly). In total, each year has a maximum of 50 stars.

Currently, I am reviewing/redoing my past solutions and uploading them here. I've either swapped laptops, or wiped my computer and therefore need to redo the code for past years....yay.

### Disclaimer about 2022 Solutions
Solutions will be uploaded a few days after their initial release (e.g., solution for day 1 will be released a day or two later, but not same day).
